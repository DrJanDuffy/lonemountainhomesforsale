          <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-stone-700">
            Lone Mountain is the ridge-and-residential pocket northwest of central Las Vegas most closely
            tied to <strong>ZIP code 89129</strong>. Buyers who type “homes near Lone Mountain” usually
            mean this ridge-line backdrop, larger-lot pockets, and a calmer rhythm than the Strip corridor—
            while still using the <strong>215 beltway</strong> to reach Summerlin offices, medical, and
            retail in reasonable time (always verify your own commute).
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold text-stone-900">What “hyperlocal” means here</h2>
          <p className="mt-3 text-stone-700">
            Within 89129 you will find a mix of established subdivisions and newer infill. Some blocks
            sit higher toward the <strong>Lone Mountain peak</strong> with long views; others nestle
            along arterials that feed <strong>US 95</strong> and the <strong>215</strong>. Micro-pockets
            can feel different block-to-block—lot size, HOA presence, and solar orientation—so it pays to
            tour in person with an agent who runs this farm weekly.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold text-stone-900">Neighbors on the map</h2>
          <p className="mt-3 text-stone-700">
            Buyers comparing Lone Mountain often also shop <strong>Skye Canyon</strong> to the northwest
            and <strong>Centennial Hills</strong> along the 215 corridor. Each has its own price cadence
            and HOA landscape; {siteContact.businessName} can help you weigh tradeoffs (views vs. newer
            build vs. commute shoulder) without the generic valley-wide noise.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-10 text-xl font-semibold text-stone-900">Schools and daily life</h2>
          <p className="mt-3 text-stone-700">
            School assignments and attendance boundaries change; confirm directly with Clark County
            School District and your chosen school before you offer. For daily errands, northwest Las
            Vegas has grown its grocery, fitness, and medical options along major corridors—your “five
            minute life” depends on the exact pocket you choose inside 89129.
